## üìä Trading Workflow

1. **Signal Reception**
   - Validate incoming webhooks (authentication, schema)
   - Parse action type (long, short, close)

2. **Rule Validation**
   - Verify market hours, timestamp freshness
   - Check allowed indices and position duplicates
   - Apply daily profit limits

3. **Trade Execution**
   - For new positions: instrument search, order calculation, position confirmation
   - For closing: position retrieval, order creation, performance reporting
   - Automatic position monitoring with stop-loss/take-profit handling

4. **Performance Tracking**
   - Daily statistics generation
   - Performance metrics reporting
   - Database storage for analysis

![telegram_notifcation.png](docs/images/telegram_notifcation.png)

## üíæ Database System

WATA uses DuckDB for fast in-memory analytics:

- **Order tracking**: Complete order and positions history with execution details
- **Position management**: P&L calculations and performance metrics 
- **Performance analytics**: Daily statistics and trading history
- **Advantages**: High-speed analytics, corruption prevention, SQL support

## üîê Authentication and Security

### Saxo Bank API Authentication

WATA uses OAuth 2.0 for Saxo Bank API integration:

1. When authenticating, the application send you a URL via Telegram (or logs of container)
2. Open this URL in your browser and log in with your Saxo credentials, and do all the steps to authorize the application (2FA, risk warning, etc.)
3. After authorization, you'll be redirected to a page with a URL containing a `code` parameter
4. Copy the code and run `watasaxoauth` on your server (you will be prompted to enter the code securely)
5. The application completes authentication using this code

**Command Reference**:
- `watasaxoauth`: Run this command and you'll be prompted to enter the authorization code securely (the code won't be visible when typing)
- The authorization code is valid only for a short time (typically a few minutes)

Please refer to the [dedicated docs pages for Saxo Authentication](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/saxo-authentication) for more details.

### Webhook Security

WATA uses token-based authentication to secure webhook endpoints:

1. Each webhook request must include a valid token in the URL (e.g., `/webhook?token=YOUR_TOKEN`)
2. This token is securely generated and stored with strong encryption
3. Manage your webhook token with the `watawebtoken` command

**Command Reference**:
- `watawebtoken`: View your current webhook token
- `watawebtoken --new`: Generate a new webhook token
- The command provides instructions on how to use the token in your webhook URL

**Security Features**:
- All tokens are encrypted before storage
- File permissions are restricted to the owner only
- IP address filtering adds an additional layer of security

## üìñ Detailed How-To Guide

For a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on setting up and using WATA, including:
- Detailed prerequisites and estimated costs
- Setting up Saxo Bank integration
- Configuring Telegram notifications
- Deploying and configuring WATA
- Setting up TradingView webhooks
- Starting and monitoring your trading

Please refer to our detailed [HOW-TO Guide](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/how-to).

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

   - Saxo Bank account with API access
   - Dedicated Ubuntu server (on VPS or local machine)
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Python 3.12+
   - Ansible (for automated deployment)
   - Telegram bot for notifications
   - _(Optional) TradingView account for webhook signals_

### Detailed Setup

For detailed setup instructions, refer to our [HOW-TO Guide](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/how-to).

### Quick Start

1. **Configure Inventory**
   - Copy the example Ansible inventory file:
     ```bash
     cp deploy/tools/ansible/inventory/inventory_example.ini deploy/tools/ansible/inventory/inventory.ini
     ```
   - Edit `inventory.ini` with your server details

2. **Build Application**
   - Build the package:
     ```bash
     ./package.sh
     ```

3. **Deploy Application**
   - Run the deployment script:
     ```bash
     cd deploy/tools
     ./deploy_app_to_your_server.sh
     ```
   - The script will use Ansible to deploy the application to your server

4. **Configure Application**
   - On the server, set up your credentials in `etc/config.json` (see below in Configuration section)

5. **Manage Application**
   Use the following aliases on your server:
   - `watastart`: Start the application
   - `watastop`: Stop the application
   - `watalogs`: View application logs
   - `watastatus`: Check application status
   - `watasaxoauth`: Launch the secure authorization code submission process
   - `watawebtoken`: View your webhook authentication token
   - `watawebtoken --new`: Generate a new webhook token


### Docker Compose Setup

The application uses Docker Compose with an override file for enhanced configuration:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - The system uses a `.env` file in the `deploy` directory to manage sensitive configuration.
   - The primary use is for setting the RabbitMQ password which is then synchronized with your config.json.

2. **Service Dependencies**
   - A special `setup` service runs before other services to ensure configuration is properly synchronized.
   - This setup updates the RabbitMQ password in your config.json file to match the one set in your .env file.
   - All other services (web_server, trader, scheduler, telegram) depend on both the setup service and the RabbitMQ service.

### Configuration

After deployment, you need to set up your configuration:

1. **Configure RabbitMQ Password**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the deploy directory
   cd /app/deploy
   
   # Copy the example .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file to set your custom RabbitMQ password
   nano .env
   ```
   
   This sets the password used by RabbitMQ and automatically updates your config.json file through the setup service in docker-compose.

2. **Copy the Example Config**
   ```bash
   cp /app/etc/config_example.json /app/etc/config.json
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**
   Edit `/app/etc/config.json` with your specific settings:

   - **Saxo Bank Authentication**
     ```json
     "authentication": {
       "saxo": {
         "app_config_object": {
           "AppName": "your_app_name",
           "AppKey": "your_app_key",
           "AppSecret": "your_app_secret"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - **WebServer Security**
     ```json
     "webserver": {
       "persistant": {
         "token_path": "/app/var/lib/web_server/persist_token.json"
       },
       "app_secret": "YOUR_STRONG_SECRET_KEY"
     }
     ```

   - **Telegram Notifications**
     ```json
     "telegram": {
       "bot_token": "your_bot_token",
       "chat_id": "your_chat_id",
       "bot_name": "your_bot_name"
     }
     ```

   - **Trading Rules**
     - `allowed_indices`: Configure allowed trading indices
     - `market_closed_dates`: Set market holidays
     - `day_trading`: Define profit targets and limits

   - **Other Settings**
     - Logging configuration
     - RabbitMQ connection details
     - DuckDB database path

   For a complete and detailed explanation of all configuration options, please refer to the [CONFIGURATION Guide](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/configuration).

4. **Restart Services**
   ```bash
   watastop
   watastart
   ```

### Usage

Send trading signals to:
```
POST /webhook?token=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

Payload:
```json
{
  "action": "long",
  "indice": "us100",
  "signal_timestamp": "2023-07-01T12:00:00Z",
  "alert_timestamp": "2023-07-01T12:00:01Z"

   ```
   This script creates a new Observable Framework project in `reporting/trading-dashboard`.

2. **Sync Trading Data**
   ```bash
   ./reporting/sync_reporting_data.sh
   ```
   This script synchronizes your trading data from the server to your local dashboard:
   - Fetches DuckDB data from your production server
   - Exports the database to Parquet format
   - Generates the necessary JSON files for visualization
   - Copies all data to the Observable Framework project

3. **Start the Dashboard Server**
   ```bash
   ./reporting/start_report_server.sh
   ```
   This launches the development server on port 4321.
   Access the dashboard at: http://localhost:4321

## üîç Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while setting up or running WATA.

### Saxo Bank API Authentication

-   **Invalid/Expired Authorization Code**: If you receive an error message about an invalid or expired authorization code during the `watasaxoauth` process, try the following:
    *   Ensure you are copying the entire code correctly from the redirect URL.
    *   The authorization code is short-lived (typically a few minutes). Generate a new URL and try the process again promptly.
    *   Check your system clock to ensure it's synchronized, as significant time differences can sometimes affect OAuth 2.0 flows.
-   **Timeout Waiting for Authorization Code**: This error indicates that the `watasaxoauth` command did not receive the authorization code within its 5-minute waiting period.
    *   Ensure you are pasting the code into the correct terminal prompt.
    *   If running WATA on a remote server, ensure your SSH session is stable.
-   **"Invalid Grant" or Similar Authentication Errors After Successful Setup**:
    *   This might indicate that the refresh token has expired or been revoked. You may need to re-run the `watasaxoauth` process to obtain a new set of tokens.
    *   Verify that the AppKey and AppSecret in your `config.json` match exactly with what Saxo Bank provided for your application.

### Docker & Deployment

-   **Docker Daemon Not Running**: Ensure the Docker service is active on your server. You can usually check with `sudo systemctl status docker` and start it with `sudo systemctl start docker`.
-   **Port Conflicts**: If a service fails to start due to a port already being in use (e.g., for RabbitMQ or the Web Server):
    *   Identify the conflicting service using `sudo netstat -tulnp | grep <port_number>`.
    *   Either stop the conflicting service or change the port WATA uses in the `docker-compose.yml` and relevant `config.json` settings.
-   **Build Failures (`./package.sh` or `docker-compose build`)**:
    *   Check for detailed error messages in the build logs.
    *   Ensure you have a stable internet connection to download dependencies.
    *   Make sure Docker has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk space).
-   **Containers Not Starting or Restarting**:
    *   Use `watalogs` or `docker logs <container_name>` (e.g., `docker logs wata-trader-1`) to check for specific error messages.
    *   Verify all necessary configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`) are present and correctly formatted.
    *   Ensure RabbitMQ is running before other services that depend on it. The `setup` service in Docker Compose should handle this, but manual checks can be useful.

### Application Configuration

-   **Incorrect `config.json` Format**: If the application fails to start or behaves unexpectedly, validate your `config.json` file.
    *   Ensure it's valid JSON. You can use an online JSON validator.
    *   Double-check all required fields are present as per `config_example.json`.
    *   Pay attention to commas, brackets, and quotes.
-   **Missing Credentials**: Ensure all sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and passwords are correctly entered in `config.json` and the `deploy/.env` file for RabbitMQ.
-   **Webhook Token Issues**:
    *   If webhook signals are not being processed, verify that the token in your TradingView alert matches the one generated by `watawebtoken`.
    *   Ensure the `web_server` component is running and accessible from TradingView's IP addresses.

### General Tips

-   **Check Logs**: The first step in troubleshooting is always to check the logs. Use `watalogs` (which aggregates logs from all services) or `docker logs <container_name>` for individual service logs.
-   **Restart Services**: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve transient issues: `watastop` followed by `watastart`.
-   **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the [detailed documentation website](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/) for more in-depth explanations of components and configurations.
-   **Check System Resources**: Ensure your server has enough RAM, CPU, and disk space available.
