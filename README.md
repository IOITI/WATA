## üéØ Purpose

WATA automates high-risk day-trading of Turbos (leveraged products) on Saxo Bank. It eliminates emotional decision-making by following predefined rules without human intervention.

> Target: 1% daily profit through algorithmic trading

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

WATA uses a microservice architecture with:

| Component (roles) | Purpose                                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Web Server**    | Receives webhook signals from third party (like: TradingView) |
| **Trader**        | Executes Saxo Bank API operations                             |
| **Scheduler**     | Manages job orchestrations                                    |
| **Telegram**      | Delivers notifications and alerts                             |
| **RabbitMQ**      | Handles inter-component messaging                             |

## üìä Trading Workflow

1. **Signal Reception**
   - Validate incoming webhooks (authentication, schema)
   - Parse action type (long, short, close)

2. **Rule Validation**
   - Verify market hours, timestamp freshness
   - Check allowed indices and position duplicates
   - Apply daily profit limits

3. **Trade Execution**
   - For new positions: instrument search, order calculation, position confirmation
   - For closing: position retrieval, order creation, performance reporting
   - Automatic position monitoring with stop-loss/take-profit handling

4. **Performance Tracking**
   - Daily statistics generation
   - Performance metrics reporting
   - Database storage for analysis

## üíæ Database System

WATA uses DuckDB for fast in-memory analytics:

- **Order tracking**: Complete order and positions history with execution details
- **Position management**: P&L calculations and performance metrics 
- **Performance analytics**: Daily statistics and trading history
- **Advantages**: High-speed analytics, corruption prevention, SQL support

## üîê Authentication

OAuth 2.0 integration with Saxo Bank API:
- Selenium-based browser authentication
- Token management with automatic refresh
- Secure storage of credentials

**Known Issue**: Currently incompatible with Saxo's 2FA system
