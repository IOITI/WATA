## üìä Trading Workflow

1. **Signal Reception**
   - Validate incoming webhooks (authentication, schema)
   - Parse action type (long, short, close)

2. **Rule Validation**
   - Verify market hours, timestamp freshness
   - Check allowed indices and position duplicates
   - Apply daily profit limits

3. **Trade Execution**
   - For new positions: instrument search, order calculation, position confirmation
   - For closing: position retrieval, order creation, performance reporting
   - Automatic position monitoring with stop-loss/take-profit handling

4. **Performance Tracking**
   - Daily statistics generation
   - Performance metrics reporting
   - Database storage for analysis

![telegram_notifcation.png](docs/images/telegram_notifcation.png)

## üíæ Database System

WATA uses DuckDB for fast in-memory analytics:

- **Order tracking**: Complete order and positions history with execution details
- **Position management**: P&L calculations and performance metrics 
- **Performance analytics**: Daily statistics and trading history
- **Advantages**: High-speed analytics, corruption prevention, SQL support

## üîê Authentication and Security

### Saxo Bank API Authentication

WATA uses OAuth 2.0 for Saxo Bank API integration:

1. When authenticating, the application send you a URL via Telegram (or logs of container)
2. Open this URL in your browser and log in with your Saxo credentials, and do all the steps to authorize the application (2FA, risk warning, etc.)
3. After authorization, you'll be redirected to a page with a URL containing a `code` parameter
4. Copy the code value and run `watasaxoauth <CODE>` on your server
5. The application completes authentication using this code

**Command Reference**:
- `watasaxoauth <CODE>`: Submit the authorization code
- The authorization code is valid only for a short time (typically a few minutes)

**Troubleshooting**:
- If you receive an invalid/expired code error, repeat the process
- A "Timeout waiting for authorization code" error means the application waited for 5 minutes without receiving the code

Please refer to the [dedicated docs pages for Saxo Authentication](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/saxo-authentication) for more details.

### Webhook Security

WATA uses token-based authentication to secure webhook endpoints:

1. Each webhook request must include a valid token in the URL (e.g., `/webhook?token=YOUR_TOKEN`)
2. This token is securely generated and stored with strong encryption
3. Manage your webhook token with the `watawebtoken` command

**Command Reference**:
- `watawebtoken`: View your current webhook token
- `watawebtoken --new`: Generate a new webhook token
- The command provides instructions on how to use the token in your webhook URL

**Security Features**:
- All tokens are encrypted before storage
- File permissions are restricted to the owner only
- IP address filtering adds an additional layer of security

## üìñ Detailed How-To Guide

For a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on setting up and using WATA, including:
- Detailed prerequisites and estimated costs
- Setting up Saxo Bank integration
- Configuring Telegram notifications
- Deploying and configuring WATA
- Setting up TradingView webhooks
- Starting and monitoring your trading

Please refer to our detailed [HOW-TO Guide](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/how-to).

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

   - Saxo Bank account with API access
   - Dedicated Ubuntu server (on VPS or local machine)
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed
   - Python 3.12+
   - Ansible (for automated deployment)
   - Telegram bot for notifications
   - _(Optional) TradingView account for webhook signals_

### Detailed Setup

For detailed setup instructions, refer to our [HOW-TO Guide](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/how-to).

### Quick Start

1. **Configure Inventory**
   - Copy the example Ansible inventory file:
     ```bash
     cp deploy/tools/ansible/inventory/inventory_example.ini deploy/tools/ansible/inventory/inventory.ini
     ```
   - Edit `inventory.ini` with your server details

2. **Build Application**
   - Build the package:
     ```bash
     ./package.sh
     ```

3. **Deploy Application**
   - Run the deployment script:
     ```bash
     cd deploy/tools
     ./deploy_app_to_your_server.sh
     ```
   - The script will use Ansible to deploy the application to your server

4. **Configure Application**
   - On the server, set up your credentials in `etc/config.json` (see below in Configuration section)

5. **Manage Application**
   Use the following aliases on your server:
   - `watastart`: Start the application
   - `watastop`: Stop the application
   - `watalogs`: View application logs
   - `watastatus`: Check application status
   - `watasaxoauth <CODE>`: Submits the authorization code to the application
   - `watawebtoken`: View your webhook authentication token
   - `watawebtoken --new`: Generate a new webhook token


### Docker Compose Setup

The application uses Docker Compose with an override file for enhanced configuration:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - The system uses a `.env` file in the `deploy` directory to manage sensitive configuration.
   - The primary use is for setting the RabbitMQ password which is then synchronized with your config.json.

2. **Service Dependencies**
   - A special `setup` service runs before other services to ensure configuration is properly synchronized.
   - This setup updates the RabbitMQ password in your config.json file to match the one set in your .env file.
   - All other services (web_server, trader, scheduler, telegram) depend on both the setup service and the RabbitMQ service.

### Configuration

After deployment, you need to set up your configuration:

1. **Configure RabbitMQ Password**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the deploy directory
   cd /app/deploy
   
   # Copy the example .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file to set your custom RabbitMQ password
   nano .env
   ```
   
   This sets the password used by RabbitMQ and automatically updates your config.json file through the setup service in docker-compose.

2. **Copy the Example Config**
   ```bash
   cp /app/etc/config_example.json /app/etc/config.json
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**
   Edit `/app/etc/config.json` with your specific settings:

   - **Saxo Bank Authentication**
     ```json
     "authentication": {
       "saxo": {
         "app_config_object": {
           "AppName": "your_app_name",
           "AppKey": "your_app_key",
           "AppSecret": "your_app_secret"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - **WebServer Security**
     ```json
     "webserver": {
       "persistant": {
         "token_path": "/app/var/lib/web_server/persist_token.json"
       },
       "app_secret": "YOUR_STRONG_SECRET_KEY"
     }
     ```

   - **Telegram Notifications**
     ```json
     "telegram": {
       "bot_token": "your_bot_token",
       "chat_id": "your_chat_id",
       "bot_name": "your_bot_name"
     }
     ```

   - **Trading Rules**
     - `allowed_indices`: Configure allowed trading indices
     - `market_closed_dates`: Set market holidays
     - `day_trading`: Define profit targets and limits

   - **Other Settings**
     - Logging configuration
     - RabbitMQ connection details
     - DuckDB database path

   For a complete and detailed explanation of all configuration options, please refer to the [CONFIGURATION Guide](https://ioiti.github.io/wata-docs/docs/configuration).

4. **Restart Services**
   ```bash
   watastop
   watastart
   ```

### Usage

Send trading signals to:
```
POST /webhook?token=YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
```

Payload:
```json
